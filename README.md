To get started, clone the repo locally

Create a "config.js" file at the root and edit it. 

Add your OpenAI API key and webhookURL(for logging) in this format:

`const config = {
  webhookURL: '[WEBHOOK URL]'
  OPEN_AI_API_KEY: '[YOUR OPEN AI API KEY]'
};`

Launch a live server of the project and you're good to go!
